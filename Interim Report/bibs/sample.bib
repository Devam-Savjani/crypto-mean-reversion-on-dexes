  abstract  = {When dot.com has become a quaint idea, when electronic shops have lost the mass attention, while classical and margin trading has become obsolete, something new is coming: cryptocurrencies. Hundreds of virtual coins have been invented for a single reason: the profit. The high price volatility of these new markets and the fact that the virtual coins price is not regulated by a central bank or a single exchange, gives us opportunities for arbitrage trading. The existence of important price differences makes possible the profit when an automated system buy cheaper and sell more expensive in the same time. This paper will present the general principles underpinning the implementation of arbitrage trading software for virtual coins market. The very large number of cryptocurrencies and exchanges fundamentally change the server architecture of the trading software. The distributed price data in hundreds of sources and the technical differences of each of these data providers make all the things difficult to be implemented in a single application. The low-latency order calculation needed for the fast delivery before a significant price change, in the presence of thousands of price quotes coming from hundreds of distributed servers makes everything special.},

These price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls for the movement of arbitrage capital. Price deviations across countries co-move and open up in times of large bitcoin appreciation. Countries with higher bitcoin premia over the US bitcoin price see widening arbitrage deviations when bitcoin appreciates. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common and an idiosyncratic component. The common component explains 80% of bitcoin returns. The idiosyncratic components help explain arbitrage spreads between exchanges.},

Regulatory authorities should consolidate cryptocurrency supervision systems and establish cross-border coordination mechanisms to stabilize exchange rates and enhance market efficiency.},

  abstract = {Abstract This survey reviews the growing literature on pairs trading frameworks, i.e., relative-value arbitrage strategies involving two or more securities. Research is categorized into five groups: The distance approach uses nonparametric distance metrics to identify pairs trading opportunities. The cointegration approach relies on formal cointegration testing to unveil stationary spread time series. The time-series approach focuses on finding optimal trading rules for mean-reverting spreads. The stochastic control approach aims at identifying optimal portfolio holdings in the legs of a pairs trade relative to other available securities. The category “other approaches” contains further relevant pairs trading frameworks with only a limited set of supporting literature. Finally, pairs trading profitability is reviewed in the light of market frictions. Drawing from a large set of research consisting of over 100 references, an in-depth assessment of each approach is performed, ultimately revealing strengths and weaknesses relevant for further research and for implementation.},

All these methods can be applied to various fields, including finance. This paper implements and analyzes the effectiveness of deep neural networks (DNN), gradient-boosted-trees (GBT), random forests (RAF), and several ensembles of these methods in the context of statistical arbitrage. Each model is trained on lagged returns of all stocks in the S\&P 500, after elimination of survivor bias. From 1992 to 2015, daily one-day-ahead trading signals are generated based on the probability forecast of a stock to outperform the general market. The highest k probabilities are converted into long and the lowest k probabilities into short positions, thus censoring the less certain middle part of the ranking. Empirical findings are promising. A simple, equal-weighted ensemble (ENS1) consisting of one deep neural network, one gradient-boosted tree, and one random forest produces out-of-sample returns exceeding 0.45 percent per day for k=10, prior to transaction costs. Irrespective of the fact that profits are declining in recent years, our findings pose a severe challenge to the semi-strong form of market efficiency.}

  abstract  = {Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) enable users to create markets for exchanging any pair of cryptocurrencies. The direct exchange rate of two tokens may not match the cross-exchange rate in the market, and such price discrepancies open up arbitrage possibilities with trading through different cryptocurrencies cyclically. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on cyclic arbitrages in DEXes. We propose a theoretical framework for studying cyclic arbitrage. With our framework, we analyze the profitability conditions and optimal trading strategies of cyclic transactions. We further examine exploitable arbitrage opportunities and the market size of cyclic arbitrages with transaction-level data of Uniswap V2. We find that traders have executed 292,606 cyclic arbitrages over eleven months and exploited more than 138 million USD in revenue. However, the revenue of the most profitable unexploited opportunity is persistently higher than 1 ETH (4,000 USD), which indicates that DEX markets may not be efficient enough. By analyzing how traders implement cyclic arbitrages, we find that traders can utilize smart contracts to issue atomic transactions and the atomic implementations could mitigate users' financial loss in cyclic arbitrage from the price impact.},

For problem (ii), the authors introduce a forecasting-based trading model capable of reducing the periods of portfolio decline by 75%. However, this comes at the expense of decreasing overall profitability. The authors also test the proposed strategy using an ARMA model, an LSTM and an LSTM encoder-decoder.},

In the existence of uncertainty in the long-term mean and the volatility of the spread, statistical arbitrage is no longer guaranteed. However, the asymptotic probability of loss can be bounded as a function of the standard error of the model parameters. The proposed framework provides a new filtering technique for identifying best pairs in the market. Backtesting results are given for some of the pairs of stocks that are studied in the literature.},

The target of the problem is to construct a portfolio of the underlying assets (possibly with an asset selection target) that can exhibit a satisfactory mean reversion property and a desirable variance property. In this paper, the optimal MRP design problem is studied under an investment leverage constraint representing the total investment positions on the underlying assets. A general problem formulation is proposed by considering the design targets subject to a leverage constraint. To solve the problem, a unified optimization framework based on the successive convex approximation method is developed. The superior performance of the proposed formulation and the algorithms are verified through numerical simulations on both synthetic data and real market data.},

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  abstract = {We investigate potential sources of emerging statistical arbitrage opportunities in the Bitcoin market across five exchanges – Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, and Kraken – via the instrumental variables approach to control for apparent endogeneity. We show that arbitrage opportunities arise when the network is congested and Bitcoin prices are volatile. Increased exchanges volume and on-chain activity increase the correlation between exchanges and thus reduce the arbitrage opportunities. These outcomes are intuitive and economically valid which supports the notion that Bitcoin market is highly volatile and risky but its behavior follows standard economic and financial intuition.}
