\chapter{Ethical Issues}

The ethics of cryptocurrencies are widely debated for reasons such as anonymity, leading it to be the choice of currency used by criminals and illegal institutions, volatility and lack of regulation. The high volatility makes cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance very risky for retail investors that don't have the technical or financial know-how making investing in cryptocurrencies.

Another aspect of cryptocurrencies that has raised ethical questions is the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission from the mining of cryptocurrencies. Formal research about this has also been completed and found that `approximately 69 million metric tons of CO2 (Carbon dioxide) emission as a result of bitcoin mining'~\cite{egiyi2020cryptocurrency}. Thus, this is an ethical concern that I have thought about when designing the strategies so that the number of transactions that don't result in a profit, i.e. do not add value to the project, is limited.

In addition to the concerns above, although this project aims to find riskless profits, \textit{`free lunches'}, it is not, in any form, of financial advice, and those who use the research or software that used in the development and research process to attempt to get favourable results, are liable for the losses or gains.
